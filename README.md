# Twitter Space Navigator

**Twitter Space Navigator** is a web platform to explore Twitter Spaces available live or scheduled to be able to go to them.
It consists only of a search engine, where you can filter by Title, Language and if it is live or not at the time of the search.

## How to use it

Clone this repository, open the project in Visual Studio 2022 and adjust the TwitterBearerToken attribute in appsettings.json with the value that the Twitter API gave you when creating a new project in developer mode.
Then just run it.
